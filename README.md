📘 Project Information – Hangman Game (Python + Tkinter)

📌 Project Title:

Hangman Word Guessing Game Using Python and Tkinter


---

👨‍💻 Developed Using:

Programming Language: Python 3.x

GUI Library: Tkinter (built-in Python module)



---

🎯 Objective:

To create an interactive Hangman game where a player guesses a hidden word letter-by-letter. The game offers clues, tracks incorrect attempts, and provides visual and textual feedback, replicating a traditional classroom-style hangman experience digitally.

✅ Conclusion

The Hangman game developed using Python and Tkinter successfully demonstrates the implementation of a classic word-guessing game in a graphical user interface. By incorporating features such as random word selection, hints, interactive letter input, limited attempts, and win/lose conditions, the project achieves its objective of offering an engaging and educational experience.

This project not only strengthens the understanding of event-driven programming and GUI design, but also reinforces key programming concepts like loops, conditional logic, functions, and string manipulation. The game’s modular structure and clear logic make it easy to expand with more advanced features such as multiplayer mode, category selection, or voice input in the future.

Overall, this Hangman project serves as a fun, interactive way to apply Python programming skills while creating a user-friendly application.
